# Number Guesser Doubles
 Is a game where two users can guess a number between 1 and 100 with the ability to add custom ranges for increased difficulty.
The game displays the names and guess of both players. The game takes the range of both players and gives a random number for players to guess.

#### Zero State
> Two inputs to set a custom range for the random number to fall within

> A button to update the custom range
for each player:

>An input field for guessing the number which can only accept numeric values

>An input field for their name that can accept any alpha-numeric character

>One button that submits both players guesses

>A button for clearing the input field, which does not reset the random number

>One button that resets the game and generates a new random number

>The clear button should be disabled if there is nothing to clear.

>The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset.
#### Players Guess State
> Display both player’s most recent guesses

> Display results and feedback for each players guess:

>If their guess is too high, it should display the error message: “That’s too high”

>If their guess is too low, it should display the error message: “That’s too low”

>If the guess is correct, it should display the success message: “BOOM!” and create a new card to display results (card details are outlined in Phase Three)
